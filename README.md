# HttpWrapper

A wrapper around the HTTPoison package. This is designed to be copied into an application, rather than installed as a package itself. It allows the application in question to have a clean interface into the http client to make upgrading or changing clients easier.

Also comes with a mock serve which allows for easy testing of API calls to external services.
